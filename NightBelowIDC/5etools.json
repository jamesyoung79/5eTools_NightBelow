										"We ended up making two books. Before {@book Flee, Mortals! The MCDM Monster Book|FleeMortals} even launched on Kickstarter, we knew that hitting our lairs stretch goal might mean another book's worth of content. When {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals} reached the layout stage, we realized that our fateful prediction was correct. We could either cut fifty pages of content from the lairs and other parts of {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals}, or we could break out the lairs into their own book, add more content, and bring our dream book of dungeons and boss battles to life. Since you're reading this, you know which route we took.",
										"The truth is that these lairs deserve to be in their own book. Each little slice of hell contains story hooks, background information, detailed hazards and NPCs, a villain, unique rewards, and all the stat blocks you need to run them. You can use this book without ever referencing {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals}",
										"The real stars of this book are the villains. Each is abominable in their own way; every lair boss is a unique monster, from their personality to their stat block. When a group of heroes invades a villain's home, that evildoer fights like hell to end the threat. We've given each villain the beefy, playtested stat block they need to stand up to even the most optimized parties.",
										"Each lair was specially crafted for the villain and their allies. A lair is an extension and example of its villain's power and personality. {@creature Lord Syuul|FleeMortals} performs his wicked experiments in a laboratory made of flesh. {@creature Kiona the Dread Lord|WhereEvilLives} obsessively researches the {@item Codex Mortis|SaF} in her extradimensional library. The once-proud {@creature Ithu'rath|WhereEvilLives} plots their grand return to the top in a crumbling castle.",
										"The boss battles and lairs in this book have saved my game nights. If I don't have anything prepared or if the players zig when I expect them to zag, I can easily grab a story hook or tempt them with some unique treasure and get them into one of these places where evil (and fun!) lives. When I'm scheming for the perfect capstone encounter to end a killer adventure, I reach for this book.",
										"The authors packed so much delicious evil into these bosses and their homes. I am incredibly grateful to them as well as all the artists, consultants, editors, playtesters, and the rest of the MCDM team who worked super hard to make more pages of content in one year than we ever have before. We, uh, learned a lot—a whole friggin' lot.",

We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, \"He is the land!\" but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds.

The medusa takes promising tomes back to her lair, where she searches for secrets to help her achieve godhood.",

										"Once a lieutenant of the Sunlight Legion, the fire giant Aastrika fought and clawed through the ranks, proving herself in battle after battle. However, she suspected many above her felt threatened by her meteoric rise, and her suspicions were confirmed when her unit was dispatched deep into the desert.",
										"There, Aastrika discovered signs of blue dragon territory and realized her superiors had ordered her into a trap. On sharing her discovery with her unit, they decided together to desert the legion. Rather than face the dragon, Aastrika and her troops pursued spiritual enlightenment. They roamed the highest sunlit mountain peaks and deepest volcanic caverns in search of understanding. In one of these magma tunnels, Aastrika crawled deep into a volcanic crater and remained for hours. When she returned, she spoke of her body discorporating into fire and of newly unearthed wisdom, and in this moment, her unit became her first spiritual followers.",
										"Returning to the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika used her newfound prowess and understanding to depose the leadership that sent her to her death. She then claimed her rightful place as warlord and spiritual leader in equal parts, preaching the importance of balance in both.",
										"Deep beneath the Roaring Peak—a sandstone mountain in the middle of the Karae Desert—the Sunlight Legion carved a home from the ancient magma tunnels where Zenith Aastrika found enlightenment. In this sacred mountain's monastery fortress, Aastrika and her comrades live, train, meditate, and grow their spiritual connection to their elemental origins.",

This is for the best, as few \"smallfolk\" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.",

There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.",

										"Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar—not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.",
										"Under new rule, Rhodar's people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches' whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny. They're right. The vampire lord is biding his time, plotting his inevitable return to power.",

For most of Xaantikorijek's existence, these caverns have been his domain alone.

On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the devil until the start of the creature's next turn, and the devil chooses a new target the devil can see for the triggering effect. The new target must be within the triggering effect's range."

Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path—even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most . . . and sometimes gives them strange abilities.",

The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper. As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends \"gnoll,\" an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is \"to consume completely.\" And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.",
												"{@b {@i Ceaseless Hunger.}} The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing; these tagalongs enjoy the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh—and they hunger for more, longing for a day when gnolls hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.",

Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god—but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.",
												"{@b {@i Cursed for Defiance.}} When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.",

New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands.
